The three main libraries used:
    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np
    import sklearn

Artifical neural networks are the software implementation of the neuronal structure of our brain.
The brain has neurons which can change their output state depending on the strength of their 
electrical or chemical input. 

A neural network is a massive interconnected network of neurons. 
Learning occurs by repeatedly activitating certian neural connections
over others, therefore reinforcing those connections. This feature makes the neurons 
more likele to produce a desired ourcome for a specified input. Learning involves 
feedback - when the desired outcome occurs, the neural connections causing that 
outcome become strenghtened.

Think of studying for a test and reading your noves over and over again to prepere for the test.

Artifical neural networks(ANN) can be supervised or unsupervised. 

In an supervised ANN, the network is trained by providing matched input and output data samples, 
with the intention of getting the ANN to provide a desired output for a given input.



The simplest neural network is a perceptron: an algorithm for supervised learning on binary classifiers.

Recall a supervised learning algorithm is the task of learning a function that maps an input 
to an output based on past input/output pairs.

A binary classifier will catorgorize elements in either: 01, TF, up down, left right, Y/N

This is a classification algorithm that makes predictions to be used on a linear predictor function
combining a set of weights w/ a featue vector.
