# Motivation
Imagine searching for a bug in your code. You create multiple print statements to pinpoint where exactly the bug is. Then we make changes to the code and test it again. We repeat this process until our code successfully again.
Neural networks work almost the same. We take multiple inputs, process it through multiple neurons from multiple hidden layers, and return the result using an output layer. This is considered <b>forward propagation<b>
