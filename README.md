# Objective
We'll train, test and validate a neural network with our credit data. The only thing we know about this data is that theres 999 rows and 27 columns. We also assume thay we can place as many neurons in the hidden layer as you like. 

# Introduction
Artificial neural networks are the software implementation of the neuronal structure of our brain. the brain has neurons which can change their output state depending on the strength of their electrical or chemical input. 

A neural network is a massive interconnected network of neurons. Learning occurs by repeadetly activiating certain neural connections. Here is a simple video explaining what a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qS83wD29PY">neuron</link> is.
